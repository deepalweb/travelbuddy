# Firebase Security Fix - Complete ✅

## What was done:
1. **Backend Config**: Uses existing `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
2. **Mobile Config**: Fetches from `/api/config/firebase` endpoint using existing `VITE_*` variables
3. **Credentials Removed**: Hardcoded values in `google-services.json` replaced with placeholders

## Your existing Azure variables are already configured:
- ✅ FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON (for backend)
- ✅ VITE_FIREBASE_* (for mobile config endpoint)

## No additional Azure setup needed!
