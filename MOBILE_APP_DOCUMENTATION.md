## Security Analysis

### Critical Security Issues Identified

#### 1. Hardcoded Credentials (Critical)
- **Location**: Multiple files including `LanguageContext.tsx`, `server.js`, `google-services.json`
- **Risk**: Exposed API keys and sensitive configuration data
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized access to external services
- **Recommendation**: Move all credentials to environment variables

#### 2. Missing Authentication (High)
- **Location**: Multiple API endpoints in backend routes
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive operations
- **Impact**: Data breaches and unauthorized modifications
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper authentication middleware

#### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (High)
- **Location**: Numerous API endpoints lack CSRF protection
- **Risk**: Malicious requests from unauthorized origins
- **Impact**: Unauthorized actions on behalf of users
- **Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens and origin validation

#### 4. Server-Side Request Forgery (High)
- **Location**: Multiple endpoints making external requests
- **Risk**: Internal network access and data exfiltration
- **Impact**: Potential access to internal services
- **Recommendation**: Validate and sanitize all external request URLs

#### 5. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (High)
- **Location**: File handling operations
- **Risk**: Unauthorized file system access
- **Impact**: Sensitive file exposure
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper path validation

#### 6. Log Injection (High)
- **Location**: Multiple logging statements throughout the application
- **Risk**: Log tampering and injection attacks
- **Impact**: Compromised audit trails
- **Recommendation**: Sanitize all logged user input

### Security Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove all hardcoded credentials
   - Implement environment variable management
   - Add authentication to all sensitive endpoints
   - Enable CSRF protection

2. **Short-term Improvements**:
