# Current Data Status Check

## Welcome Card Data Sources:

### ‚úÖ REAL DATA (Currently Working):
- **Username**: From Google Sign-In ‚Üí "dee"
- **Profile Picture**: Google avatar URL
- **Location**: GPS coordinates (37.7749, -122.4194 fallback)

### üé≠ SMART MOCK (AI-Generated):
- **Daily Suggestions**: Generated based on:
  - Real time of day
  - Real weather conditions  
  - Real user travel style
  - Real location context

### ‚ùì DEPENDS ON API AVAILABILITY:
- **Weather**: Real if weather API works, mock if fails
- **Weather Forecast**: Real if API works, mock 3-hour forecast if fails

## To Get More Real Data:
1. Backend needs to implement these endpoints:
   - `GET /api/users/{userId}/daily-suggestions`
   - `GET /api/discoveries/local`

2. Weather API needs proper configuration:
   - Valid weather API key
   - Working weather service endpoints

## Current Status:
- User sees REAL profile data
- Weather may be real or mock depending on API
- Suggestions are contextually generated (smart mock)
- Everything works regardless of backend status
