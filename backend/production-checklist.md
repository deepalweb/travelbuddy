## ðŸ”„ SSL Certificates - SETUP REQUIRED

### For Production:
1. **Obtain SSL Certificate**
   ```bash
   # Using Let's Encrypt (recommended)
   certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Copy certificates to backend/ssl/**
   ```bash
   cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem ./ssl/cert.pem
   cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem ./ssl/key.pem
   ```

3. **Enable HTTPS in environment**
   ```bash
   ENABLE_HTTPS=true
   ```

### For Development:
```bash
cd backend/ssl
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

## ðŸ”„ Environment Variables - SECURE REQUIRED

### Move to Production Environment:
```bash
# Remove from .env file and set in hosting environment
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_production_secret
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
MONGO_URI=your_production_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
```

## ðŸ”„ Webhook Configuration - SETUP REQUIRED

### PayPal Webhook Setup:
1. **Login to PayPal Developer Console**
2. **Create Webhook Endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/paypal/webhook`
3. **Subscribe to Events**:
   - PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED
   - PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED
   - BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED
   - BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED
4. **Copy Webhook Secret** to `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## âœ… Production Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backend APIs | âœ… Ready | All endpoints implemented |
| PayPal Integration | âœ… Ready | Credentials need production values |
| Database | âœ… Ready | MongoDB schemas created |
| Security | âœ… Ready | Environment-based config |
| SSL Certificates | ðŸ”„ Setup Required | Need production certificates |
| Webhook Handlers | âœ… Ready | Need webhook URL configuration |

## ðŸš€ Deployment Commands

### Start Production Server:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### Health Check:
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/test-deployment
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Key Endpoints to Monitor:
- `/health` - Server health
- `/api/subscriptions/*` - Subscription operations
- `/api/payments/*` - Payment processing
- `/api/webhooks/paypal/webhook` - Payment confirmations

### Logs to Watch:
- PayPal webhook events
- Payment verification results
- Subscription status changes
- SSL certificate expiration

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

1. **Never commit production credentials to git**
2. **Use environment variables for all secrets**
3. **Enable HTTPS in production**
4. **Verify webhook signatures**
5. **Implement rate limiting for payment endpoints**
6. **Monitor for suspicious payment activity**
