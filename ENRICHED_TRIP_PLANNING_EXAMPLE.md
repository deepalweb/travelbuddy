# Enriched Trip Planning Service - Example Output

## Problem Solved
The original trip planner generated generic, placeholder content like:
```
08:30-09:30: jaffna City Center
Enjoy jaffna City Center in beautiful jaffna.

10:00-12:00: Local Market Visit
Enjoy Local Market Visit in beautiful jaffna.
```

## New Enriched Output
The new service generates rich, contextual content using real Google Places data:
