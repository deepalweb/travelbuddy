## Design Direction

The admin portal should feel professional, authoritative, and data-rich while maintaining clarity and ease of use. Design should convey trust and competence with a clean, dashboard-focused interface that handles complex data elegantly.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Professional Blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) - Conveys authority, trust, and professionalism for admin interfaces
