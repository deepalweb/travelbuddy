- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] SQL injection protection verified
- [ ] XSS protection headers added
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] Authentication middleware on protected routes
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### 6. Mobile App Security
- [ ] Certificate pinning implemented
- [ ] ProGuard/R8 enabled for Android release
- [ ] Code obfuscation enabled
- [ ] Debug logging disabled in release
- [ ] API endpoints use HTTPS only
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted in local storage

### 7. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (SSL certificates configured)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] File upload restrictions implemented
- [ ] Directory traversal protection
- [ ] Server information headers removed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### 8. Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Security linting rules enabled
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Penetration testing performed

## üîß Azure App Service Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_production_key
MONGO_URI=your_production_mongodb_uri
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_openai_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_production_endpoint
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON=your_service_account_json
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Security Headers Configuration
Add to `web.config` or application settings:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## üîç Pre-Deployment Testing

### Security Tests
- [ ] API endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting works correctly
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] File upload restrictions work
- [ ] CORS configuration tested
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration verified

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database connections work
- [ ] External API integrations functional
- [ ] Mobile app connects to production backend
- [ ] Payment processing works (if enabled)

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] SSL certificate valid
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### Security Verification
- [ ] No sensitive information in logs
- [ ] API rate limiting active
- [ ] Authentication working correctly
- [ ] HTTPS redirect functioning
- [ ] Security headers present

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Credentials Compromised
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Update environment variables
3. Restart application
4. Monitor for unauthorized access
5. Review access logs

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep previous working deployment
2. Database backup before deployment
3. Quick rollback procedure documented
4. Emergency contact information ready
